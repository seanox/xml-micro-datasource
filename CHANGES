  BF: Service: Optimization of CONNECT
      Status 507 (Insufficient Storage) now only occurs when a new storage is
      to be created, but not when connecting to an existing one.
  BF: Service: Optimization of CORS
      Correction for a correct preflight OPTIONS request.
      Change to the full notation of the Access-Control header.
      Omission of the automatic prefix.
  CR: Service: Added support for condition header
      Each request can be combined with the header condition. An XPath function
      expression that explicitly returns a true is expected, otherwise the
      request is quituted with status 412 (Precondition Failed) and aborted.
      It is useful e.g. for conditional PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests.
  CR: Service GET/POST: Added support for accept header: application/json
      The header enforces the transformation of XML output as JSON.
      If the return value is not application/xslt+xml, the header has no effect
      on the output. The client is informed via the Content-Type whether the
      transformation was used.
