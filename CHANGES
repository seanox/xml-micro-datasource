  BF: Service: Optimization of CONNECT
      Status 507 (Insufficient Storage) now only occurs when a new storage is
      to be created, but not when connecting to an existing one.
  CR: Service: Added condition header
      Each request can be combined with the header condition. An XPath function
      expression that explicitly returns a true is expected, otherwise the
      request is quituted with status 412 (Precondition Failed) and aborted.
      It is useful e.g. for conditional PUT/PATCH/DELETE requests.
